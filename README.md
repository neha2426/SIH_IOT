 This code is for the pole side where we are installing a
Camera along with the gps ,gsm ,and ARDUINO .
As we install many camera's on the electric poles 
It will become difficult to identify the correct
location of the pole so the gsm and GPS module will help
to do so .
This will help to send the location of that particular pole
where the crime is being detected and also an emergency
message to the nearby police station or ambulance

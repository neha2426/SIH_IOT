 GSM and GPS code is for the pole side where we are installing a
Camera along with the gps ,gsm ,and ARDUINO .
As we install many camera's on the electric poles 
It will become difficult to identify the correct
location of the pole so the gsm and GPS module will help
to do so .This will help to send the location of that particular pole
where the crime is being detected and also an emergency
message to the nearby police station or ambulance 
In case any crime will happen inside any car,bus etc the victim can carry a band which will consist of 
transmitter ,and when victim will press the button for the help the signal is transmitted to the nearest reciver 
and immediately  snd notification to the emergency number provided. for we have code in the IOT file
